# Optimal Locker Problem

Problem Statement: There is a locker system with n lockers of different sizes. We need to store the packages
as they arrive in store and empty the lockers when the package has to be dispachted.
sizes in which locker and packages came are : small, medium and large for now.
small package can be stored in small locker or medium locker or large locker and same for medium package it can
be stored in medium or large only and large package can be stored in large locker only.

Use the optimal algo for designing the locker system.

Requirements:
1. The delivery guy should be able to find an "optimal" locker for a package.
2. Users should be able to use a code to open a locker and pick up a package.
